App Description: Briefly explain – in  your own words - what the app does. Describe the purpose of each activity and how they work together.
The app allows a user to enter a person's information, including first name, last name, and phone number. When the user clicks add passenger, this information
is recorded and displayed on the current passenger list. Once the user finishes adding passengers, they can return to the original activity, which also displays
the passengers. When the user clicks on "get passenger list" again, the list is reset and allows the user to enter a new list. The main activity's purpose is to
show the current/most recently returned list. The GetPassengers activity's purpose is to allow a user to enter passenger information to save one list at a time
and view the saved list on the main activity.

Challenges and Solutions: Share any obstacles you encountered while building your app – one or two will do. How did you solve these issues?
Since the directions didn't specify(unless I overlooked), I needed to implement my own way to modify the accum_list

Key Learnings: Reflect on what you learned about Kotlin programming, XML layouts, and passing data between activities.
Future Improvements: If you had more time, what might you add to this app? How would you enhance its functionality?
